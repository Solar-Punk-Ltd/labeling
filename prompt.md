Get all the open issues from ethersphere/... github repo and one by one depending on the title and the conversation advise labels for each issue, use the labels definied in rules.md. don't add any label yet, just give me a table. Use the code to detemine the difficulty and try to estimate priority and have a guess for the kind label. Then print CLI commands to add the labels to the issues while keeping the current labels.
